I have used Tailwind CSS for the first time to develop any website. It was a great learning process for me. I learned a lot about Tailwind CSS. This Project also helps me a lot to under how logic works in Js. It was a fun learning process for me.

### Future Plan

I will add some features in the future. In the future users can create an 11 players team from the selected players. Users must select 15 players for creating a team and they can select a maximum of 18 players.
